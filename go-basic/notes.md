## Modules, Packages and Imports:

Library manages in go consist of Repository, Module and Packages.

**Repository:** A repository is a version-controlled storage space for your code, typically hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Repository = Collections<modules>

In Go projects, the repository often contains one or more modules and serves as the main container for project source code. A repository is not specific to Go; It’s a general concept used across all programming languages to manage and track code.

Example: Imagine you are developing a library for handling `payment-processing` 
    
1. You might create a GitHub repository named `github.com/username/payment-library`.

 2. Inside this repository, you could have various modules or packages for handling different aspects of payments (e.g., credit card processing, wallet support).

**Module:** A module in Go is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together. Example: ReposModuleitory = Collections<Packages>

Modules are the fundamental unit of dependency management in Go. A module is defined by a `go.mod` file, which specifies the module's path (often the repository URL) and dependencies. 
 1. The `go.mod` file tells the Go tool where to find packages and which versions to use, making dependency management easier
 2. A Go project can have multiple modules, but typically, a single module suffices for many projects.
    
Example: Continuing from the repository example, you could define a module within it:

 ``` go mod init github.com/username/payment-library```

This command creates a `go.mod` file with `github.com/username/payment-library` as the module path. All packages in this repository now belong to this module.

Contents of `go.mod`:
```
module github.com/username/payment-library

go 1.20
require github.com/some/dependency v1.2.3

```
**Package:** A package in Go is the smallest unit of code organization and is essentially a collection of related Go source files.

Each Go file within a package shares the same `package` name at the top of the file. Packages are where actual code is implemented, and they can be imported into other Go programs to reuse functionality.

1. By convention, Go packages are organized within folders, with each folder containing one package.
2. The `main` package is special because it defines an executable program, whereas other packages typically define reusable libraries.

Example:
Within your payment module, you could have several packages:
```
payment-library/
├── go.mod
├── payment/
│   ├── creditcard.go      // package payment
│   ├── wallet.go          // package payment
├── utils/
│   ├── helper.go          // package utils
└── main.go                // package main
```
Here’s how the files might look:
1. `creditcard.go` in the `payment` package:
```
package payment

func ProcessCreditCard() {
    // Implementation here
}

```
2. `helper.go` in the `utils` package:
```
package utils

func ValidatePaymentDetails() {
    // Validation code here
}

```
3. main.go in the main package (for executing the application):
```
package main

import (
    "github.com/username/payment-library/payment"
    "github.com/username/payment-library/utils"
)

func main() {
    payment.ProcessCreditCard()
    utils.ValidatePaymentDetails()
}

```

Summary:
1. **Repository:** The main storage unit for your project code (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). A repository may contain one or more modules and packages.

2. **Module:** A collection of Go packages, versioned together, and defined by a go.mod file. It’s the unit of dependency management.

3. **Package:** A single unit of code organization within a module. Each folder generally contains one package, and each package may contain several related functions or types.

The `go mod tidy` command in Go is used to clean up and optimize your module's dependencies in the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.


#### Creating and accessing a package in module

```
# Initialize a new Go module (run in the root directory of the module)
go mod init <module-path>
# Example: go mod init github.com/username/repository-name/module-name

# Download and tidy up dependencies (removes unused packages)
go mod tidy

# Update dependencies to the latest versions (based on semantic versioning)
go get -u ./...

# Add or upgrade a specific dependency
go get example.com/some/dependency@latest

# List all dependencies in the module
go list -m all
```
